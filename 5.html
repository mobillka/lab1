  <div id="block-4"><p>There was a little cat named Shadow. He lived in a cozy house with a big, sunny window. Every morning, Shadow would sit by the window, watching the world go by.

One day, he spotted a butterfly fluttering outside. Shadow's eyes followed it closely as it danced through the air. With a sudden leap, he tried to catch it, but the butterfly was too quick.

Shadow landed softly on the floor, looking a bit surprised but very determined. He sat there for a moment, then shook his paws and decided to try again tomorrow.
