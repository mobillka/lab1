  <div id="block-4"><p>Mr. Meow was no ordinary cat. He had a special talent: he could make the loudest meow in the neighborhood, which he used only when absolutely necessary.

One day, while napping in his favorite sunny spot, he heard a faint, worried meow coming from the garden. It was his friend, Squeaky, a tiny mouse who had gotten stuck under a flowerpot.

Without hesitation, Mr. Meow sprang into action. He puffed up his chest and let out his most powerful MEOW! The flowerpot rattled and tipped over, freeing Squeaky.

"Thank you, Mr. Meow!" squeaked Squeaky, grateful.

Mr. Meow just gave a small, satisfied purr and returned to his nap.</p></div>
