Kitty, the curious cat, loved exploring the attic. One day, she found a dusty old box and jumped right in. Inside, she discovered a collection of shiny things—buttons, ribbons, and a golden key.

With a little meow of excitement, Kitty carried the key in her mouth, feeling like a brave explorer. She tried it in every lock she could find, but nothing opened. Disappointed, she sighed, but then, the box gave a little click.

Inside it was a tiny treasure: a soft, velvet mouse toy. Kitty’s eyes sparkled with joy as she pounced on her new prize, her adventure complete.</p></div>
